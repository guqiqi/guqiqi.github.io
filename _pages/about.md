Hi, this is Qiqi! I'm currently a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) candidate in Computer Science at the Shanghai Key Laboratory of Scalable Computing and Systems, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I earned my Master of Engineering in Software Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University between September 2020 and March 2023, advised by Prof. Jianguo Yao. Previously, I obtained my Bachelor of Engineering in Software Engineering from Nanjing University, graduating in 2020 after commencing my studies in 2016.

My research interests includes **System Optimization for Artificial Intelligence and High-Performance Computation (HPC)**. Notably, my work on uncovering the structured sparsity patterns within Large Language Models (LLMs) and accelerating Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models through Sparse Tensor Cores has been accepted by EuroSys 2025. Additionally, I am currently engaged in researching methods to accelerate LLM Systems using emerging hardware technologies.

<!-- neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->
